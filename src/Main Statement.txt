Hi, 
I’m ISO.Hi
I’m a high school senior in the Bay Area, born in Guangdong, China, and photography is how I interact with he world frame by frame and step by step.

When I was little, my dad’s work took our family around the world. He always carried a small camera, capturing moments of me in places I can barely remember now. Most of my childhood exists not in memory, but in those photos stored on his old hard drive — I adopted these fragments of me. That’s when I first realized the power of photography.

Years later, at eleven, we returned to the same vista point along California’s Highway 1 with a tall fence and a single tree. My parents asked me to pose with a victory hand sign beside it. I didn’t understand why until I dug through old drawers back home and found it: a photo of myself, years younger, standing in the exact same spot, in the exact same pose. The frame hadn’t changed — but I had.

Still, it wasn’t until 2022, on a trip to Qianxinan, that I truly fell in love with photography.

My dad’s work allowed a time and space to travel all around the world when I was very small. He had a small camera and took a lot of photos of me. 
I almost have no memories of my early childhood. Sometimes I would flip over the photos in my dad’s hard drive, and that’s how I adopt fragments of
childhood. I realize the power of photography.

The day passed by, and I grew from a wimpy kid to my mom and dad’s so-called “teenager” – 11 years old. We went back again to the US Highway 1, where we’d been several years before. I sat on the passenger seat, feeling proud of myself when the car stopped at a vista point with a tall fence and a big tree. My parents told me to get out of the car and take a photo of me holding a victory hand sign near that tree. I wondered why, since there wasn’t a great view, and it seemed they were familiar with that place. I suddenly remembered something, went back home, dug into all the drawers, and I found something – a picture of me in exact pose at the exact spot when I was small.


But it wasn't until 2022, on a trip to Qianxinan, that I fell in love with photography.
