INTRO

Hi, 
I’m ISO.Hi
I’m a high school senior in the Bay Area, born in Guangdong, China, and photography is how I interact with he world frame by frame and step by step.

When I was little, my dad’s work took our family around the world. He always carried a small camera, capturing moments of me in places I can barely remember now. Most of my childhood exists not in memory, but in those photos stored on his old hard drive — I adopted these fragments of me. That’s when I first realized the power of photography.

Years later, at eleven, we returned to the same vista point along California’s Highway 1 with a tall fence and a single tree. My parents asked me to pose with a victory hand sign beside it. I didn’t understand why until I dug through old drawers back home and found it: a photo of myself, years younger, standing in the exact same spot, in the exact same pose. The frame hadn’t changed — but I had.

Still, it wasn’t until 2022, on a trip to Qianxinan, that I truly fell in love with photography.

My dad’s work allowed a time and space to travel all around the world when I was very small. He had a small camera and took a lot of photos of me. 
I almost have no memories of my early childhood. Sometimes I would flip over the photos in my dad’s hard drive, and that’s how I adopt fragments of
childhood. I realize the power of photography.

The day passed by, and I grew from a wimpy kid to my mom and dad’s so-called “teenager” – 11 years old. We went back again to the US Highway 1, where we’d been several years before. I sat on the passenger seat, feeling proud of myself when the car stopped at a vista point with a tall fence and a big tree. My parents told me to get out of the car and take a photo of me holding a victory hand sign near that tree. I wondered why, since there wasn’t a great view, and it seemed they were familiar with that place. I suddenly remembered something, went back home, dug into all the drawers, and I found something – a picture of me in exact pose at the exact spot when I was small.


But it wasn't until 2022, on a trip to Qianxinan, that I fell in love with photography.

2022.07 Guiyang
It was a summer before my freshmen year, I signed up for a volonteer project trip to Banwancun, Guiyang.We helped this little village
to build a local resturant serving local meals called firepit meal, where people sit around the firepit to cook, eat, and talk. The project wasn't fun though, the trip is amazing.
The village is deep inside a mountain that isolates from large towns and cities. I've spent 9 hours travelling from my home to this village and after I've arrived at the diestination,
I took this photo on my phone (2022.07 Guiyang/Weixin Image_20251031224330_79_11.jpg). The sunset sprays on the mountain cliff far away, and part of the village, houses and building is in the foreground.
What a nice picture, I though.
The project lasted for 2 weeks and just before we left, our leader gave me a postcard printed from his photo taken on his camera during the projects.
I was amazed; the my photo is a long exposure of buildings in night, the dim light of the house and the star light in the sky, with villagers' motion blurred.

It was the summer before my freshman year. I signed up for a volunteer trip to Banwancun, a small village deep in the mountains of Guiyang. Our team helped build a local restaurant serving traditional “firepit meals,” where people sit around the fire to cook, eat, and talk. The work itself wasn’t particularly exciting—but the journey was unforgettable.  After a nine-hour trip from home, I arrived at the village and took a photo on my phone. The sunset spilled across the distant cliffs, washing the roofs and narrow streets below in warm light. I remember thinking, what a beautiful picture.  The project lasted two weeks. Just before we left, our team leader handed me a postcard printed from one of his own photos—a long exposure taken at night. The houses glowed faintly in the dark, starlight shimmered above, and the blurred silhouettes of villagers moved across the frame.  That image stayed with me. It was the first time I understood how a photograph could hold more than a scene—it could hold time itself.
