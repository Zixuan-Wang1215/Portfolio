            <p>I'm a high school senior in the Bay Area, born in Guangdong, China, and photography is how I interact with the world as an aesthetic observer.</p>
            <p>When I was little, my parents would say, "1, 2, 3, cheers!" as they snapped pictures on our trips — the Grand Canyon, Niagara Falls, Cuba, cities all over China.</p>
            <p>I don't remember the views anymore.</p>
            <p>But I remember the photos.</p>
            <p>Years later, I found an old picture of me standing by a tree on Highway 1 — the same spot my parents took me back to years later. The frame hadn't changed, but I had.</p>
            <p>In 2022, on a trip to Qianxinan, I fell in love with photography.</p>
            <p>Scroll down to see my storytelling through images.</p>
